#Panic Button - NoFap Emergency
##For [Reddit's r/NoFap](https://reddit.com/r/NoFap)
NoFap Emergency is to get you to the right content when you need it. Recently gave a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9pPgIraoOM) at Binghamton about this.

Also on [Android](https://github.com/jackfischer/NoFap-Phonegap) and [iOS](https://github.com/danielx0328/NoFap). Much thanks to [Daniel Romero](https://github.com/danielx0328) for his work.

There's also a [bookmarklet](https://emergency.nofap.com/director.php?cat=bookmarklet) (drag to your bookmarks bar) that goes straight to emergency.
