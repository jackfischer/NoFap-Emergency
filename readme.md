# Panic Button - NoFap Emergency
## For Reddit's [r/NoFap](https://reddit.com/r/NoFap)
NoFap Emergency is to get you to the right content when you need it. Recently gave a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9pPgIraoOM) at Binghamton about this.

The API has since been rolled into other NF services so this repo now just contains the UI. Also on [Android](https://github.com/csanonymus/NoFap-Android) and [iOS](https://github.com/danielx0328/NoFap), much thanks to [Daniel Romero](https://github.com/danielx0328) and our anonymous Android developer for their work. [Suggest a link](https://emergency.nofap.com/suggestor.php) or report any broken links if you see them. If you're interested in using this as an API or something, [email me](mailto:jack.fischer11@gmail.com) or [Alexander Rhodes](mailto:rhodes@nofap.com).
