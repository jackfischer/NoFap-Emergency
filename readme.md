#Relapse Prevention Tool - NoFap Emergency
##For [Reddit's r/NoFap](http://reddit.com/r/NoFap)
NoFap Emergency is to get you to the right content [when you need it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2ik023/take_red_or_blue_pill/)
There's also a [bookmarklet](http://emergency.nofap.com/director.php?cat=bookmarklet) (drag to your bookmarks bar) that goes straight to emergency.
Recently gave a [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9pPgIraoOM) at Binghamton about this.

Here are a couple of the big Reddit discussions:

* [Thank you for the relapse prevention tool!](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2fvyhb/thank_you_for_the_relapse_prevention_tool/)
* [I just noticed this, but HOLY SHIT, THE NEW RELAPSE EMERGENCY TOOL IS SO COOL](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2g05rx/i_just_noticed_this_but_holy_shit_the_new_relapse/)
* [Emergency nofap tool rocks](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2grt82/emergency_nofap_tool_rocks/)
* [Let me just Take a Moment to appreciate the people who put the work in to develop the Panic Button](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2jvsjk/let_me_just_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_the/)
* [The panic button saved my life. Thank you (misleading)](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2ov1x1/the_panic_button_saved_my_life_thank_you/)
